What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git directory is created. This is needed to create a directory where git will store all metadata.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is like a intermediate space b/w working directory and repository. This area allows you to pick changes that needed to commit to repository leaving rest in working directory.
