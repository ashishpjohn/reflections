When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to share my content with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I may not be periodically changes things that need auto up-date. Manual gives me control on how i want to maintain remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branch: to maintain 2 more timlines for local changes.
Clone: used to clone a repository. Mostly from remote to local.
Fork: used to clone someone else repository to your remote space.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It helps you revert back whenever you feel a need to go back to old state.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Manual or some other version control. The offline/online option while using git will be difficult to recreate.
